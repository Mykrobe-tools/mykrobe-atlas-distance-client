# distance_client
<p>An API for CRUD of two types of distances <li> between a sample and its closest samples <li> between a sample and its closest phylogenetic tree node <p>This API is intended to satisfy the following user stories <li> as a user, I want to add my new sample and its close neighbours so that I can retrieve them later <li> as a user, I want to query a sample for its close neighbours and their nearest nodes in a phylogenetic tree <li> as a user, I want to query a sample for its close neighbours so that I can do my analysis <li> as a user, I want to query a sample for its nearest node in a phylogenetic tree so that I can do my analysis <li> as a user, I want to update a sample with new list of close neighbours so that they are correct <li> as a user, I want to update a sample with new nearest leaf node in a phylogenetic tree so that it is correct <li> as a user, I want to remove the nearest leaf node in a phylogenetic tree from a sample so that it is correct <li> as a user, I want to remove a sample so that it is no longer available to any users <li> as a user, I want to add a new leaf node to the phylogenetic tree <li> as a user, I want to remove a leaf node from the phylogenetic tree <li> as a user, I want to query a tree node for a list of samples which have this as nearest tree node

- API version: 1.0.0
- Package version: 1.0.0
- Build package: org.openapitools.codegen.languages.PythonClientCodegen

## Requirements.

Python 2.7 and 3.4+

## Installation & Usage
### pip install

If the python package is hosted on a repository, you can install directly using:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git
```
(you may need to run `pip` with root permission: `sudo pip install git+https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID.git`)

Then import the package:
```python
import distance_client 
```

### Setuptools

Install via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

```sh
python setup.py install --user
```
(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import distance_client
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation procedure](#installation--usage) and then run the following:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import time
import distance_client
from distance_client.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint


# Defining host is optional and default to http://distance-api-service/api/v1
configuration.host = "http://distance-api-service/api/v1"
# Create an instance of the API class
api_instance = distance_client.LeafDeleteApi(distance_client.ApiClient(configuration))
id = 'id_example' # str | 

try:
    api_instance.samples_id_nearest_leaf_node_delete(id)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling LeafDeleteApi->samples_id_nearest_leaf_node_delete: %s\n" % e)

```
