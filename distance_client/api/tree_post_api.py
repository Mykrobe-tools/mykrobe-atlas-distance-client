    Distance API

    <p>An API for CRUD of two types of distances <li> between a sample and its closest samples <li> between a sample and its closest phylogenetic tree node <p>This API is intended to satisfy the following user stories <li> as a user, I want to add my new sample and its close neighbours so that I can retrieve them later <li> as a user, I want to query a sample for its close neighbours and their nearest nodes in a phylogenetic tree <li> as a user, I want to query a sample for its close neighbours so that I can do my analysis <li> as a user, I want to query a sample for its nearest node in a phylogenetic tree so that I can do my analysis <li> as a user, I want to update a sample with new list of close neighbours so that they are correct <li> as a user, I want to update a sample with new nearest leaf node in a phylogenetic tree so that it is correct <li> as a user, I want to remove the nearest leaf node in a phylogenetic tree from a sample so that it is correct <li> as a user, I want to remove a sample so that it is no longer available to any users <li> as a user, I want to add a new leaf node to the phylogenetic tree <li> as a user, I want to remove a leaf node from the phylogenetic tree <li> as a user, I want to query a tree node for a list of samples which have this as nearest tree node  # noqa: E501
